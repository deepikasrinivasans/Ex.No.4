# Ex.No.4 AI-Powered Virtual Health Assistant Using Scenario-Based Prompt Engineering   

### NAME: DEEPIKA S
### REGISTER NUMBER : 212222230028

### Aim: 
To design an AI-powered virtual health assistant that helps patients with basic medical inquiries, appointment scheduling, and health reminders.
The assistant should maintain a friendly and empathetic tone, while providing accurate and accessible information.
This experiment explores diverse prompting techniques (Comparative Analysis Prompts, Universal Prompts, Structured Prompts, Refinements, and Prompt Size Limitations) for developing the assistant.

### 🧩 Idea Generation Prompts

### Prompt: “What core features should a virtual health assistant include to improve patient engagement and efficiency?”

### Generated Ideas:

- 💬 24/7 chatbot for answering FAQs (symptoms, diet tips, precautions).

- 📅 Automated appointment booking system.

- ⏰ Smart reminders for medicines and check-ups.

- 🔍 Symptom checker (non-diagnostic, advisory only).

- 🌐 Multilingual support for diverse patients.

---

### 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Persona & Context Prompts

### Prompt: “How should the assistant communicate differently with patients and doctors?”

### Generated Context:

- 👩‍⚕️ For Patients:

- Simple, empathetic, and reassuring tone.

- Example: “Don’t worry, I’ll remind you to take your medicine at 8 PM tonight.”

- 👨‍⚕️ For Doctors:

- Concise, professional summaries of patient interactions.

- Example: “Patient X reported mild fever for 2 days; appointment scheduled for Friday 4 PM.”

  ---

### ⚙️ Structured Prompts for Use Case

- Instruction Prompt: “Summarize patient’s last 3 chat interactions in under 50 words for doctor’s dashboard.”

- Comparative Prompt: “Compare morning vs evening medicine reminder schedules for better adherence.”

- Refinement Prompt: “Rewrite the response to sound more empathetic for elderly patients.”

- Limitation Prompt: “Generate advice under 30 words suitable for SMS reminders.”

  ---

### ⚠️ Challenges

- ❌ Ensuring medical advice remains non-diagnostic and guideline-compliant.

- ❌ Balancing conciseness with clarity in limited word prompts.

- ❌ Handling multilingual communication without losing empathy.

- ❌ Maintaining strict data privacy (HIPAA/GDPR compliance).

  ---

### 🚀 Future Scope

- 🧠 Integration with wearables for real-time health monitoring.

- 🌐 Use of federated learning for secure AI improvements.

- 🤝 Expansion into telemedicine platforms.

- 📊 Predictive analytics for early health risk detection.
